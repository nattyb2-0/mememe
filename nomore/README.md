The reason behind recreating this app is that it means so much to be because i've been in the situation with no viable solution, and i know so many that would love to have a product like this....hence the reason i enrolled in the program.

Technologies:
-React
-React Router
-Socket.io
-Oauth
-Expess and Node ....or Rails
-photo uploader

User Story
when a person arrives at the site the will land on an impressively sleek landing page from which they can find out what the app is for, sign up, log-in and/or browse all the story boards that have been created by users, as well as search for inmates on the site.
As a logged in user...you can search to see if there is a story board created already for an inmate that you know. If there is one, you can subscribe/follow that board and now begin posting your pics, stories, etc to the board.
If a board does not exist...the user can then create a board for the user and begin to post to that board.
From the user logged in home page they have a feed through which they can see activities going on around the board(s) they are subscribed to.
